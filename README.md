Step 2: Apply for the product using your University Email Address and having your username as your UCID

Step 3: Once completed the form, download Webstorm and use the free trail until an email is sent to you of a code to activate your free version. 

Step 3: Go to google and search Git or use link "https://git-scm.com/downloads" and download the application. 

Step 4: Go to Github.com and make an account using your University Email

Step 5: Open the application "Webstorm" and go into System Preferances by using shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+S). After select version control, select Git, and on Path to Git executables, enter "C\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe". (If you have changed the location of Git on your computer, right click on the shortcut icon, properties, and will give you a directory of where the file is located)

Step 6: Still on System Preference, go to Apperance and Behavior, into System Settings, into Passwords, and add a location to the password file

Step 7: Go onto the webpage "Github" and to create your first Repository, on the top right corner, click on the "+" and choose to "Create New Repository"

Step 6: Make the Repository public and add a readme file, afterwards confirm and create the file  

Step 9: Go onto Webstorm now and create a new project, after go to main meny and choose VCS, with Create Git Repository

Step 10: Now to import a Repository, go into webstorm and select VCS and checkout from version contro Git, and enter the name and enter the local path name

Step 11: Now to create a new file on webstorm, choose File, then HTML, then HTML5, and on the top left task bar, it should say GIT, and now you will be able to add to locak file system

Step 12: Save your work and add a Commit your change

Step 13: Push change into Remote Repository by (Ctrl+Shift+K)

Step 14: Go to Github to see that the file is now on your Github by clicking your profile

Step 15: Furthermore, you can go into settings on Github Pages and check the Repository name

Step 16: You can chack the source into Master Branch and save these changes to allow to publish a URL

Step 17: Check your github page and you are all set to use Webstorm, Github, and Git

    Glossary: 
    
    Branch: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
    
    Clone: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
    
    Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
    
    Fetch: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.
    
    GIT: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.
    
    Github: GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.
    
    Merge: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
    
    Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
    
    Push: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.
    
    Pull: Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.
    
    Remote: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
    
    Repository: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
